# Malaysian Aviation Consumer Protection RAG

> Work in progress. The evaluated local RAG pipeline and FastAPI application are implemented. Docker packaging and final portfolio presentation remain.

## Problem

Malaysian aviation analysts may need evidence from consumer-protection codes, amendments, and service-quality reports. Manual search becomes slow when questions require a specific rule, effective date, historical statistic, or evidence from multiple documents.

This project builds an evaluated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant for evidence-based questions about Malaysian aviation consumer protection and service quality.

The intended user is an aviation consumer-experience or service-quality analyst. This is a portfolio prototype, not an internal Malaysia Aviation Group system, and not legal advice.

## Publication Model

This repository uses a bring-your-own-data workflow.

Published:

- source code and tests
- document metadata and official source links
- sanitized evaluation questions, rankings and metrics
- notebooks without saved outputs
- retrieval and generation configurations

Not published:

- source PDFs
- extracted pages or chunks
- embeddings
- API keys
- generated-answer files containing retrieved context

Users must obtain documents from the official URLs in `data/manifests/documents.csv`, review the applicable terms, and build derived artifacts locally.

## Local Evaluation Corpus

Version 1 used the Malaysian Aviation Consumer Protection Code 2016, its 2019 and 2024 amendments, and Consumer Reports for 2H2023, 1H2024, 2H2024 and 1H2025.

Local processed totals:

- 201 extracted pages
- 186 retrieval-eligible pages
- 368 chunks

Document IDs, URLs, filenames, access dates, extraction methods and SHA-256 values are recorded in the manifests.

## System Design

```text
Official documents downloaded locally
-> extraction and cleaning
-> page metadata and exclusions
-> 140-word page-bounded chunks
-> TF-IDF retrieval + BGE retrieval
-> weighted reciprocal rank fusion
-> top-five evidence context
-> Gemini generation
-> citation validation
-> FastAPI response
```

Selected retrieval configuration:

- 140 words with 25-word overlap
- `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`
- 20 candidates per retriever
- RRF constant 60
- equal TF-IDF and BGE weights
- final context depth 5

Selected generation configuration:

- Gemini 3.5 Flash
- prompt `dev_v2`
- temperature 0
- thinking budget 0
- maximum output 500 tokens

## Evaluation Design

- 12 development questions for design and prompt comparison
- 28 locked questions for final baseline evaluation
- 23 locked answerable questions
- 5 locked refusal questions

Categories include direct regulatory lookup, temporal reasoning, amendment comparison, report fact retrieval, cross-document synthesis and refusal.

Answerable questions use manually verified page-level gold evidence. The locked dataset was hashed before evaluation.

## Retrieval Results

Development results used nine answerable questions:

| Configuration | Recall@1 | Recall@3 | Recall@5 | Hit@5 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| TF-IDF, 140 words | 0.389 | 0.778 | 0.778 | 0.778 |
| MiniLM, 140 words | 0.167 | 0.278 | 0.278 | 0.333 |
| BGE, 140 words | 0.222 | 0.500 | 0.704 | 0.778 |
| Hybrid TF-IDF and BGE | **0.537** | **0.704** | **0.815** | **0.889** |

First locked retrieval run:

- Recall@1: 0.414
- Recall@3: 0.709
- Recall@5: 0.772
- Hit@1: 0.565
- Hit@3: 0.870
- Hit@5: 0.870

Direct regulatory lookup and report retrieval were strong. Cross-document synthesis was the main retrieval failure.

## Answer Results

First locked answer run:

- micro fact coverage: 0.768
- fact-complete rate: 0.696
- full-answer pass rate: 0.609
- citation validity: 0.870
- citation support: 0.957
- faithfulness: 1.000
- correct-refusal rate: 1.000
- clean-refusal pass rate: 0.600

The system was faithful to supplied evidence, but faithfulness did not guarantee completeness. Manual scoring was AI-assisted and reviewed against frozen expected answers, required facts, forbidden inferences, citations and retrieved evidence.

## Main Findings

### Neural retrieval was not automatically better

TF-IDF substantially outperformed MiniLM. BGE improved semantic matching but did not beat TF-IDF on total gold-page coverage. The hybrid performed best because lexical and semantic methods recovered different evidence.

### Token limits changed chunking

Whole-page chunks exceeded MiniLM's token limit in 51.6% of cases. The selected 140-word strategy avoided truncation in the evaluated embedding models.

### Cross-document synthesis remained difficult

Single-query retrieval often found only one intent. Some required pages entered candidate rankings but fell below the top-five context cutoff. Others never entered the candidate set.

### Faithfulness was not enough

Locked answers achieved 1.000 faithfulness but only 0.609 full-answer pass rate. A grounded answer can still be incomplete.

## Project Structure

```text
data/manifests/               Metadata, hashes and exclusions
evaluation/                   Questions, configurations and sanitized metrics
notebooks/                    Exploration and evaluation notebooks 01 to 06
src/aviation_rag/             Reusable ingestion, retrieval, generation and API code
tests/                        Unit and integration tests
```

Important application modules:

- `runtime.py`: loads frozen configuration and builds the answer service
- `api.py`: defines HTTP requests, responses and safety checks
- `main.py`: manages production startup and shutdown

## Local Setup

Python 3.13 is required.

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Download the documents using the URLs and filenames in `data/manifests/documents.csv`, then place them in `data/raw/`.

Build derived datasets:

```powershell
aviation-rag-build-pages --project-root .
aviation-rag-build-chunks --project-root .
```

Expected totals are 201 pages, 186 eligible pages and 368 chunks.

## Tests

```powershell
python -m pytest -q
```

Current result:

```text
104 passed
```

Tests use temporary files, fake embedding models and fake Gemini clients. They do not require the local corpus or consume API quota.

## Local API

Create an untracked `.env` file:

```text
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Run:

```powershell
python -m uvicorn aviation_rag.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --env-file .env
```

Swagger is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

Endpoints:

- `GET /health`
- `POST /ask`

The API validates input, reuses startup-managed RAG resources, retries temporary provider failures, rejects invalid citation attempts and maps provider failures to HTTP 503.

## Reproducibility and Integrity

- raw and derived corpus files are excluded from Git
- document hashes detect source changes
- prompt SHA-256 validation detects prompt changes
- the locked dataset is hashed
- retrieval configuration was frozen before locked evaluation
- notebook outputs are cleared before publication
- ranking artifacts retain IDs, pages, scores and labels without text

## Limitations

- document use and redistribution terms must be reviewed by each user
- BGE embeddings are recomputed at server startup
- Gemini quota can make generation unavailable
- no authentication, rate limiting or load testing
- cross-document synthesis remains weak
- cross-page provisions can lose context
- manual scoring contains reviewer judgment
- no public corpus or hosted endpoint is provided
- this system must not replace official documents or legal advice

## Remaining Work

1. Persist semantic embeddings to reduce startup time.
2. Add deployment-readiness checks and runtime logging.
3. Package a local bring-your-own-data Docker workflow.
4. Add an architecture diagram and portfolio screenshots.
5. Complete the final repository audit.

## Document Rights

The official documents and derived corpus are not distributed in this repository.

Public availability does not automatically grant redistribution permission. Users are responsible for reviewing source-site terms, document notices, copyright and permitted use before processing documents.

This repository publishes an engineering workflow and sanitized evaluation evidence. It does not grant rights to third-party documents.
